I loved the movie

I hated the movie

"Nearly all of the footage in the film is incredible, both in terms of content and restoration."

poor acting

"There's a potent irony between the justice that Kelly, Carlson and others sought and their politics, both in real life and on the screen, that the film never addresses in a satisfactory way. [Full review in Spanish]"

 this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i m not going to waste any more words on it
  "As horror stories go, it's sometimes funny. As comedies go, it's pretty horrifying."

 "It's a movie on a powerfully ambitious scale. Its subject could hardly be more relevant."
